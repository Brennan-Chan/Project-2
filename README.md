# Project-2
STA 2450

Assignment Details: 
Start with the Person class similar to the code we used in lecture. The code for this class can be found in the file person_class.py Download person_class.py 

Create another class called Student that will inherit the Person class. This class should have an attribute for an id number, class (freshman, sophomore, etc.), and major. The major attribute does not need to be set when the Student is initialized but the other attributes should. 

The Student class should also have an attribute called gradebook. This gradebook should contain assignment names and the score for the assignments. You decide what structure you need to do this.

Your Student class should have a method that will print the general information of the student (name, age, id number, class, and major) to the console. 

You should have another method that will change the major for the student. 

Add another method that will add an assignment to the gradebook. 

The last method should print a message to the console that lists all the assignments and grades for that student. 

 

At the end of your program, show examples of your code. You should show at least four students with each having at least three assignments in their gradebooks. 

All code should be properly documented along with your overall program. Proper naming conventions should also be used.

Name your file as Proj2_lastname_firstname.py.  See the syllabus for the grading rubric. 

You will work in Groups of 3 for this project. The groups are found under People on Canvas.
